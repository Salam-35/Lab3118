# Git Branch

Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug no matter how big or how small you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.

---

## Common Options
```
git branch
```
List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with git branch --list.

```
git branch <branch>
```
Create a new branch called ＜branch＞. This does not check out the new branch.
```
git branch -d <branch>
```
Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.
```
git branch -D <branch>
```
Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.
```
git branch -m <branch>
```
Rename the current branch to ＜branch＞.
```
git branch -a
```
List all remote branches. 
## Creating Branches
It's important to understand that branches are just pointers to commits. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointer, it doesn’t change the repository in any other way.
Then, you create a branch using the following command:
```
git branch crazy-experiment
```
## Creating remote branches
So far these examples have all demonstrated local branch operations. The git branch command also works on remote branches. In order to operate on remote branches, a remote repo must first be configured and added to the local repo config.
```
$ git remote add new-remote-repo https://bitbucket.com/user/repo.git
# Add remote repo to local repo config
$ git push <new-remote-repo> crazy-experiment~
# pushes the crazy-experiment branch to new-remote-repo
```
This command will push a copy of the local branch crazy-experiment to the remote repo ＜remote＞.
## Deleting Branches
Once you’ve finished working on a branch and have merged it into the main code base, you’re free to delete the branch without losing any history:
```
git branch -d crazy-experiment
```
However, if the branch hasn’t been merged, the above command will output an error message:
```
error: The branch 'crazy-experiment' is not fully merged. If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D crazy-experiment'.
```
This protects you from losing access to that entire line of development. If you really want to delete the branch (e.g., it’s a failed experiment), you can use the capital -D flag:
```
git branch -D crazy-experiment
```
This deletes the branch regardless of its status and without warnings, so use it judiciously.

# Git Merge
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.

## Preparing to merge
Before performing a merge there are a couple of preparation steps to take to ensure the merge goes smoothly.

 _**Confirm the receiving branch:**_
Execute git status to ensure that HEAD is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch. If needed, execute git checkout to switch to the receiving branch. In our case we will execute git checkout main.

 _**Fetch latest remote commits:**_
 Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes. Execute git fetch to pull the latest remote commits. Once the fetch is completed ensure the main branch has the latest updates by executing git pull.

_**Merging:**_
Once the previously discussed "preparing to merge" steps have been taken a merge can be initiated by executing git merge where  is the name of the branch that will be merged into the receiving branch.

## Fast Forward Merge
A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch. Instead of “actually” merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move (i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip. This effectively combines the histories, since all of the commits reachable from the target branch are now available through the current one. 

However, a fast-forward merge is not possible if the branches have diverged. When there is not a linear path to the target branch, Git has no choice but to combine them via a 3-way merge. 3-way merges use a dedicated commit to tie together the two histories. The nomenclature comes from the fact that Git uses three commits to generate the merge commit: the two branch tips and their common ancestor.

The code below creates a new branch, adds two commits to it, then integrates it into the main line with a fast-forward merge.

```
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature main
# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"
# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"
# Merge in the new-feature branch
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
```
